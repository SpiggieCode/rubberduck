RubberDuck is a browser based virtual chat application.
Users can bounce their ideas off of their little rubber duck companion and he will respond with a helpful quack.
For those looking for more interactivity, there's also an option to enter an openai api key which will allow a virtual duck personality to engage in the conversation.

Everything is handled browser side, no information is recorded or saved.
